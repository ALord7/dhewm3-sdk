# Perfected Doom 3

The source code to build the game DLLs for both Perfected Doom 3 and Perfected Doom 3 RoE for dhewm3.

Thanks to *VGames* for releasing the source under GPL!

You can download the mod itself at https://www.moddb.com/mods/perfected-doom-3-version-500/downloads

**Note** that you should **rename the `Perfected/` game directory to `perfected/`**, and **`Perfected_ROE` to `perfected_roe`**, because Doom3 doesn't like upper-case characters in mod directories, especially on operating systems that are case-sensitive, like Linux.
