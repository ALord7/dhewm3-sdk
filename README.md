# Blood Mod 1.5

Thanks to *ALord7* for giving me the mods source code for porting!

You can download the game data at https://www.moddb.com/games/doom-iii/addons/blood-mod-15

Note that you **must rename the mod's directory from `BloodMod/` to `bloodmod/`** because Doom3 doesn't support uppercase mod directories (at least on case-sensitive operating systems like Linux).  
I'd also suggest removing the `autoexec.cfg`, because amongst other things it sets `sys_lang` to "russian", which probably doesn't make too much sense unless you play the game in Russian.
