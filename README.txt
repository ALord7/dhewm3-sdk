This allows you to run the Hard Corps mod in dhewm3!

It's the updated/remastered version of the HardQore2 mod for Doom3.

A big thank you to Revility (and the rest of the HardQore2 team) for releasing
the source under GPL, so I could port it to dhewm3 - and for explicitly
developing Hard Corps for dhewm3! :-)

You can  get the game data at:
https://www.moddb.com/mods/hardcorps/downloads

Revility's Hard Corps git repo: https://github.com/revility/hardcorps
It only contains changed files, so it doesn't compile as it is but needs
the dhewm3 SDK as a base. I recommend just using the code hosted here
( https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3-sdk/tree/hardcorps ), it works as it is.
